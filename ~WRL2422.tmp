# BuildingBlockchain
 Simple code for creating BlockChain

How it is work:
	The blocks created by Starting Node. For first node there is no previous key means nil. While creating the chain of blocks, we observe the rule that hash of the previous block is added to the current block. Means Starting node hash code and second node input we are creating current node hash. And store total information in that node like (Current Hash, Input Value, and Previous Hash).
